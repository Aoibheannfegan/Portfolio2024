            You know, if you told my younger self that I&apos;d be geeking out over software development, 
            I would&apos;ve laughed but life has a funny way of throwing surprises at you. I started off 
            with a degree in English and History, which I loved. Fast forward a bit, and I found myself
             deep in the world of sales and operations management. It was great, really. I got to meet loads 
             of people, solve problems, and learn a ton about what makes a business tick.
            </p>
            <p>
              But then, something clicked. About 4 years ago I got involved in this project at work, 
              setting up a B2B eccomerce platform, and it was like a whole new world opened up for me.
              My brother (a Full Stack Engineer), seeing me get all excited about tech stuff,
              suggested I try out a computer science course from Harvard(CS50). 
              I thought I&apos;d just be learning a new skill, but it turned out to be a whole lot more.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started exploring more, taking on more software implementation and automation projects 
              at work, and casually continuing my coding education on the side. About a year ago, 
              it became pretty clear to me that coding was what I was passionate about and so 
              I intensified my studying, took more courses and built more projects. I loved the feeling 
              of getting lost in a complex problem or finishing a project and having the rush of knowing 
              that that was something I had created.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, here I am, on this somewhat unconventional path, diving headfirst into software development 
              and loving every bit of it. It&apos;s not just about changing careers; it&apos;s about finding 
              something that excites me every day.
            </p>
            <p>
            I can&apos;t wait to see where this road is taking me and learn what I can build and learn along the way. 
            Let&apos;s see where this adventure goes!
